**Abut Me**

I’m a new learner in web development, eager to dive into the world of coding and design. I’m currently building my skills in front-end and back-end development, exploring how to create functional, user-friendly websites. My journey is just beginning, but I’m committed to learning and growing every day. With a focus on mastering the basics and expanding my knowledge, I’m excited to contribute fresh ideas and bring projects to life as I continue to develop my abilities.
